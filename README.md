# Libft-42

# Libft - Your Coding Adventure Begins! 🚀
Welcome to the world of "Libft," my very own first library! 📚 This project is my second endeavor at 42, following the epic journey of "Piscine Reloaded."

# Project Goal 🎯
The mission? Code a C library packed with handy functions that will become your trusty companions in all future projects. Here's the catch – at 42, you're the hero crafting these functions from scratch! No standard C library functions allowed, except for a select few: write() from <unistd.h>, malloc(), and free() from <stdlib.h>. Oh, and you can also buddy up with <string.h> for some size_t and NULL action.

Ready to watch your library evolve with more and more functions? 🌱

# Dive into LIBFT 🚀
Behold, LIBFT, your second project at 42! 🎉 Brace yourself for a wild ride of function creation, where you'll meticulously check every nook and cranny for potential pitfalls. Only three standard library functions are at your disposal – write(), malloc(), and free(). But fear not, for you're also allowed to tap into <string.h> for size_t and NULL.


# Adventures in Coding! 🧑‍💻
Recreating these functions is not just about typing code – it's a grand exercise in understanding the intricate details, limitations, and unexpected surprises of each function. Unit testing is the ultimate challenge, making this journey a rollercoaster of learning and fun!

Join the LIBFT quest and let the coding adventure begin! 🚀🌟
